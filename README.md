# FirstLegPracticeGo

This list of exercises refers to Golang programming studies and corresponds to the first part of the study.

The list involves variable manipulation and programming logic.

# Welcome to the First Golang Practice

Lets practice what we have been studying.

1. Create a program that displays the message "Hello world" on the screen.

2. Create a program that requests a number and then displays the message "The number entered was [number]".

3. Create a program that requests two numbers and prints the sum.

4. Create a program that requests the 4 numbers and displays the average.

5. Create a program that converts meters to centimeters.

6. Create a program that asks how much you earn per hour and the number of hours worked in the month. Calculate and display your total salary for the month in question.

7. Create a program that requests the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, converts it and displays it in degrees Celsius.
Use the formula = C = (5 * (F-32) / 9).

8. Create a program that calculates a person's ideal weight using the person's height as input data. Use the following formula: (72.7*height) - 58

9. Create a program that calculates a person's ideal weight, using the person's height (h) as input. Use the following formulas:
For men: (72.7*h) - 58
For women: (62.1*h) - 44.7

10. Create a program that asks how much you earn per hour and the number of hours worked in the month.
Calculate and display your total salary for the month, knowing that 11% is deducted for income tax, 8% for social security and 5% for the union. Create a program that gives us:
gross salary.
how much you paid to social security.
how much you paid to the union.
net salary. Calculate the discounts and the net salary, according to the table below: + Gross Salary: R$ - IR (11%): R$ - INSS (8%): ​​R$ - Union (5%): R$ = Net Salary: R$ Note: Gross Salary - Discounts = Net Salary. 

11. Create a program that asks for the size of a file to download (in MB) and the speed of an Internet link (in Mbps), calculate and inform the approximate download time of the file using this link (in minutes). 

# Decision structures

12. Create a program that asks for two numbers and prints the largest of them.

13. Create a program that asks for a value and shows on the screen whether the value is positive or negative.

14. Create a program that checks whether a typed letter is a vowel or a consonant.

15. Create a program to read two partial grades of a student.
The program should calculate the average achieved by each student and display:
The message "Approved", if the average achieved is greater than or equal to seven;
The message "Failed", if the average is less than seven;
The message "Approved with Distinction", if the average is equal to ten.

16. Create a program that reads three numbers and displays the largest of them.

17. Create a program that reads three numbers and displays the largest and smallest of them.

18. Create a program that asks for the price of three products and tells you which product you should buy, knowing that the decision is always the cheapest.

19. Create a program that reads three numbers and displays them in descending order.

20. Create a program that reads the price of a product and inflates that price by 10% if it is less than 100 and by 20% if it is greater than or equal to 100.
